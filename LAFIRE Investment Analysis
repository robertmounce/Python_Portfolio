This reflects a $17.5 million (2%) reduction from the previous year’s $837 million budget, primarily due to staffing cuts, adjustments in salary accounts, and the removal of one-time expenses. Key changes include a $6.96 million reduction in salaries and a $10.59 million cut in general expenses.\n\n\n# 2. CAL FIRE Open Data- Data aset on fire incedents, prevention efforts and fuel management\n- Using the CAL FIRE Fuels Reduction Projects \n\n## 1. CAL FIRE Fuels Reduction Projects - Main Application\n- This dataset includes information on recent and ongoing fuels reduction projects, a key component of wildfire prevention and a major area of investment.\n\t• Potential Use: Analyze the geographical distribution of projects and the correlation between fuels reduction and wildfire frequency/severity.\n\n## 2. CAL FIRE Damage Inspection (DINS) Data (from earlier lists)\n• Why: Contains detailed data on structures impacted by wildfires. It can help assess whether increased investments in fire prevention have led to reduced structural damage.\n• Potential Use: Compare structural damage before and after specific investments or projects.\n\n## 4. California Fire Perimeters (1950+)\n• Why: Historical fire perimeters are essential for long-term trend analysis and assessing the impact of fire prevention investments over time.\n• Potential Use: Compare fire activity before and after increased funding or major projects.\n\n## 5. Facilities for Wildland Fire Protection\n• Why: Includes a statewide depiction of CAL FIRE and contract facilities, such as fire stations. Understanding the distribution of fire suppression resources is crucial for evaluating investment allocation.\n• Potential Use: Analyze how resource distribution correlates with fire response times and fire containment success.\n## 6. Fire Hazard Severity Zones Viewer\n• Why: This dataset classifies land into fire hazard severity zones, helping to identify high-risk areas and evaluate if investments are being directed effectively toward these zones.\n• Potential Use: Study whether high-risk areas receive more investment and whether it impacts fire incidence or severity.\n\n## 7. CAL FIRE Working Forest Management Plans and Notices\n• Why: Covers approved management plans for sustainable forest use, a critical aspect of reducing long-term fire risk.\n• Potential Use: Analyze forest management efforts and their relation to fire prevention and investment trends.\n\nDataset analysis Potentials: \n- Trend Analysis: Use historical fire data and budget allocations to track how fire activity has changed over time in response to investments.\n- Geospatial Analysis: Map fire perimeters, hazard zones, and project areas to assess the geographical impact of investments.\n- Impact Assessment: Evaluate whether increased investments in fuels reduction and forest management correlate with reduced fire damage and incidents.\n\n\n3.

With billions of dollars allocated to fire prevention and firefighting efforts, it’s important to ask: Are these investments making a difference? This project aims to explore the relationship between government spending on firefighting infrastructure, prevention programs, and real estate in wildfire-prone zones, while also considering innovative programs like the incarcerated firefighters initiative.\n\n### Key Questions\n1.\tHow much is being invested in firefighting infrastructure, such as equipment, stations, and training?\n2.\tWhat does the government budget allocation for the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) look like?\n3.\tAre there private or public investments in fire prevention, such as wildfire mitigation or community safety programs?\n4.\tHow do real estate investments in fire-prone areas factor into fire risk and preparedness?\n5.\tWhat kinds of environmental investments are being made to reduce wildfire risks in LA?\n6.\tHow does the incarcerated firefighters program contribute to firefighting efforts, and what does it cost?\n\n### Funding Overview\n•\t2022-23 State Budget: California allocated $3.7$ billion to CAL FIRE for wildfire prevention and response.\n•\tWildfire Prevention Grants: CAL FIRE awarded $90.8 million in grants to 94 local wildfire prevention projects.\n\n### Data Sources\n1.\tCity of Los Angeles\n  •\tLAFD FY 2024-25 Budget:\n    The adopted budget totals $920 million, with $819 million for salaries and operations and $101 million for equipment, fleet replacement, and facilities maintenance. Notably, this represents a 2% reduction from the previous year’s budget.\n  •\tPurpose: This data will be used to analyze how local fire department funding impacts operational effectiveness and resource allocation.\n2.\tCAL FIRE Open Data\n    Key datasets include:\n        • Fuels Reduction Projects: Data on ongoing and completed projects aimed at reducing fire risk by managing vegetation.\n        • Damage Inspection (DINS) Data: Contains detailed information on structures impacted by wildfires, useful for assessing the effectiveness of fire prevention investments.\n        • California Fire Perimeters (1950+): Historical data on wildfire perimeters, enabling long-term trend analysis.\n        • Fire Hazard Severity Zones: Classifies high-risk areas, helping to assess whether investments are focused on zones most vulnerable to wildfires.\n3.\tOpenFiscal - California’s Financial Transparency Portal\n        • Department Spending Transaction Files: Detailed records of CAL FIRE spending from FY 2019 to FY 2024.\n        • Vendor Transaction Files: Identifies companies and organizations receiving payments, offering insight into who is delivering fire-related services.\n\n## Metrics for Analysis\n\nTo answer the key questions, the following metrics will be analyzed:\n\t1.\tAnnual Budget Allocation for fire departments and prevention programs.\n\t2.\tNumber of Fire Incidents Over Time: Track whether increased spending correlates with fewer or less severe wildfires.\n\t3.\tSpending per Incident: Calculate how much is being spent per fire incident to assess cost-effectiveness.\n\t4.\tArea Burned vs. Investment: Determine if higher investment reduces the total area burned.\n\t5.\tResponse Time and Outcomes: Evaluate if increased spending improves response times and reduces damage.\n\n## Analysis Plan\n1. Trend Analysis: Visualize how investments in fire prevention and response have changed over time.\n2. Correlation Analysis: Explore the relationship between spending and fire incidents to determine if investments are reducing wildfire frequency or severity.\n3. Geospatial Analysis: Use mapping tools to analyze the geographical distribution of investments and compare them with high-risk zones.\n4. Return on Investment (ROI): Evaluate the effectiveness of spending by analyzing how much property damage or loss of life has been prevented.\n5. Forecasting: Apply time-series models to predict future spending needs based on historical trends and fire risk.\n\n### Objective\nThis analysis will provide a data-driven understanding of whether investments in firefighting and fire prevention are yielding measurable results in Los Angeles and across California. By combining financial data with fire incident records and geospatial information, we aim to answer: Is LA’s fire spending enough to keep up with the increasing threat of wildfires?\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Final Insights Reflection\nThe Palisades Fire has created a lot of government, insurance backlash into the damages that it has caused. I became interested in this topic due to amount of families and with a political enviroment I wanted to use this event to practice and solve my questions into how and if this government has caused a great misstep. I will be looking at the level of investment that the california fire department as well as the LA Fire Deppartment. I have been hearing from the news into a bunch of different outcomes. \nIncluding that the investment went down 100 million to it not being funded correctly. I do want to keep my bias from interferring, so I just want to look at the data.
